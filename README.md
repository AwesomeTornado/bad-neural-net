# bad-neural-net
a class based neural network library that I designed in middle school.

this is an upload of my project as-is, the main loop is filled with my code. you can just delete it and write your own, or you can use it as an example of how to use this project.

there are a couple custom librarys that I made for this project. I cant remember what I named them, so you will have to figure that out on your own.
one of them is filled with small functions that made my code easier or smaller. stuff like print vector, and make resizeable multidimentional array.
the other is to read the mnist database of hanwritten digits, as my goal was to recognise numbers with this project. unfortunatly, that never actually worked because this neural network appears to have some severe learning disabilities.

have fun poking through this mess!
